# Code Slide Template

## Setup

- Clone the repository
- Run a server (`python -m http.server` works well on the command line)
- Open the page in your web browser (`http://localhost:8000/` if you used the command above)
- Click the button to open your slides

## Writing slides

- Copy and paste a `section` element to make more slides. Change the `class` of the `pre` element for different programming language highlighting.

- column width for code is about 43 characters.

## Code animation

Add the `data-line-numbers` or `data-no-line-numbers` attribue to your `code` block to animate particular lines.

For example, `data-line-numbers="1|2-3|5|` will highlight line 1, then line 2 and 3 together, then line 5 and finally all lines together.

## Keyboard Shortcuts

- Use left and right arrow keys to navigate slides
- Use `r` to resize window to 1280x720 (for screen recording)

## Possible recording flow

- Use OBS and set 'screen capture' input to the window showing your code.
